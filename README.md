# Kanji Koohii

**Kanji Koohii** (previously known as "Reviewing the Kanji") is a web application designed to help Japanese language learners memorize the kanji. This repository is used to track development of the website, and allow users to report bugs and make suggestions. http://kanji.koohii.com

## The "Staging" Website

The "staging" website is an alternate version of the website including changes in development.

You can find it at : **staging • koohii • com**

*VERY IMPORTANT: it is connected to the live database, meaning you login with your same credentials, any changes happen to your real account.*

## Contributing Feedback

Both **issues and suggestions** can be posted in the Issues tab. Just click [New issue](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues/new) and voila! I will assign tags eventually.

## Other Ways to Contribute

The website is not in a state for publishing fully on Github. See [Open Source Status](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/wiki/Open-Source-Status).

I am looking at ways to accept contributions via components. For example if I author a Vue JS component I could create a separate repo for that, so I can both share re-usable parts and accept improvements for the website. In that way I can expose just parts that are more up to date, and don't have to worry too much about all the legacy code I have to manage.

The [design/PSDs folder](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/tree/master/design/PSDs)  contains some resources that you can use if you want to contribute alternative better designs. Ask me if I can add something there.

The outdated documentation page of the website is also a good example of content that could be community maintained (as a Markdown file that I can include in the site build). I'll figure out things like that as I get to grips with Github.
