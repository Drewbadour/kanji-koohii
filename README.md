[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/kanji-koohii/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/feedback?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)  Ask any questions about the repo, issues, etc. in the *development* channel.

Consider **Watching** the repository, if you often visit Github (dropdown at the top of the screen).

Let me know **if you have an area of interest** like the flashcards or Study pages, or maybe general SQL knowledge you'd like to contribute and we'll figure out something.

I use [Milestones](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/milestones) to group issues in categories of interests such as front end / user experience / back end / etc.
