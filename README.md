## Feedback & Suggestions

Create an "issue" in the Issues tab. [New issue](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues/new).


## Contributing

Let's talk [on Gitter](https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/development). The "feedback" room is intended for user feedback and testing. The "development" room is where we can talk about the code (that way testers can opt out of notifications from the development chat). Note there are Android and iOS clients with push notification support. Desktop client also shows the recent repository activity.

[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/kanji-koohii/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/feedback?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge)

Have a look at [Milestones](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/milestones). I use them to group issues in categories of interests such as front-end performance, UX improvements, etc. If you'd like to contribute something not on the issue board, reach me on Gitter and we'll see how it fits into the site, then break it down into smaller tasks and create issue(s) as required.

### Branches

I find this basic master/develop/feature-branch to be sufficient so far.

* **master** is meant to be the last stable, production version.
* **develop** is a branch where features are merged.
* **f_feature** a feature branch.


## Development setup

Development requires a typical LAMP setup (Apache/MySQL/Php) with a shell. The setup is currently tested on Ubuntu. The build script should work with very little changes on OS X. For Windows, you'll probably want a virtual machine with a linux distro so you can use grep, npm etc.

* [First Time Setup](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/wiki/Open-Source:-First-Time-Setup) for setting up the repository and database
* [Build](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/wiki/Open-Source:-Build) for basic info about dev/test environments
* [Docs](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/wiki/Open-Source:-Docs) has links to the MVC framework documentation (Symfony).


## Project Roadmap

* **HTTPS** will be enabled soon (hopefully April 2017)
* **Refactoring** legacy php templating to Vuejs client-side components
* **Vocabulary features** : "favorite" example words in Study pages, create a vocab deck and review with SRS
* **Improve Study pages** : better moderation & voting system, stroke order animations, better search
* **Improve the API** for third party clients like [Kanji Ryokucha](http://forum.koohii.com/thread-12829.html)
