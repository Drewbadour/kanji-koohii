**Kanji Koohii** (previously known as "Reviewing the Kanji") is a web application designed to help Japanese language learners memorize the kanji. This repository is used to track development of the website, and allow users to report bugs and make suggestions. http://kanji.koohii.com

## The "Staging" Website

The "staging" website is an alternate version of the website including changes in development.

You can find it at : **staging • koohii • com**

*VERY IMPORTANT: it is connected to the live database, meaning you login with your same credentials, any changes happen to your real account.*

## Contributing Feedback

Post **issues and ideas** on the Issues tab. Just click [New issue](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues/new) and voila!

Join the *feedback room* on [![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/Lobby](https://badges.gitter.im/kanji-koohii/Lobby.svg)](https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/feedback?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge&utm_content=badge). Note Gitter, on desktop at least, has a history of Issues and Comments, so it's a good way also to keep track of conversations.

Another good way to follow up changes to staging, is **Watching** the repository (dropdown at the top of the screen).

## Labels USed in the Issue System

**NEXT**: [issues I'm working on](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3ANEXT)

**DISCUSSION**: [issues labelled discussion](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Adiscussion%20) are opened indefinitely and are less focused. They are intended to brainstorm fixes or features. Any concrete steps that come out of it will be added as separate issues.

## Other Ways to Contribute

The website is not in a state for publishing fully on Github, yet. I may chose to go with a private repository and talk with Gitter, we'll see. I can't accept **pull requests** without prior discussion because I am continually maintaining a codebase with code written over the past ten years. Lots of decisions I make that are not explicit in the code necessarily, because I know I will phase out this or that, or refactor some parts, at some later point. So I don't think a public repository is manageable. Talk to me on Gitter if you are interested! (still planning this)

**Design**: the [design/PSDs folder](https://github.com/fabd/kanji-koohii/tree/master/design/PSDs)  contains resources that you can use if you want to contribute alternative better designs. Ask me if I can add something there.
