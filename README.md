## Contributing

Both **issues and suggestions ** can be posted in the Issues tab. Just click [New issue]() and voila! I will assign tags eventually.

If I assign the tag `someday-maybe` it means I like the idea but as a solo developer doing this in my spare time I'm just being honest and acknowledging it is not planned any time soon. That said if such an issue is seeing repeated activity, who knows. It really depends how complex it is, and whether some work can be delegated.
