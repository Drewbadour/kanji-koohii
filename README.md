## Contributing
Realistically speaking, nobody wants to work on a very old codebase. That said, should you want to contribute some bug fixes, or some improvements here and there, help is welcome.

#### Project History
Keep in mind I started the website all the way back in the [August 2005](https://kanji.koohii.com/news/2005/8). The website was pretty much one-php-script-per-page for the first year. It was known then as "Reviewing the Kanji". A year or so later, I created a very barebones MVC inspired by Symfony 1. Thankfully because I followed the same API and conventions than Symfony a few years later I was able to refactor to the actual Symfony 1 package.

#### Installation
Installation is fairly simple with Docker CE. The MySQL container includes a sample database with a selection of the "top" voted kanji stories. See [Installation](doc/Installation.md) and [Database](doc/Database.md) guides.


## Project Roadmap

* **Refactoring** legacy php templating to Vuejs client-side components
* **Vocabulary features** : "favorite" example words in Study pages, create a vocab deck and review with SRS
* **Improve Study pages** : better moderation & voting system, stroke order animations, better search
* **Improve the API** for third party clients like [Kanji Ryokucha](https://twitter.com/kanji_ryokucha)
