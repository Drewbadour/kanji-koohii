## Contributing

Update March 22 : full repo should be working. [Reach me on Gitter](https://gitter.im/kanji-koohii/development) for any questions related to setting up and working with the repo. **Issue system + docs** still need to be worked on. So drop me a line if you want some suggestions for simple things to get around the code base.
