/**
 * vue-bundle.js - the main vue bundle including vue (standalone) and common components used across the app
 *
 * 
 * VUE BUILD & INSTANCING COMPONENTS
 *
 *   Components should be designed in a way that they are *instanced* by Javascript into the page.
 *
 *   For example, the mobile nav is not generated unless user click/tap the hamburger icon, only then
 *   the mobile nav component is instanced and generated into the page.
 *
 *   Why?
 *   
 *   - Speed:          components are pre-compiled.
 *       
 *   - Optimization:   eventually, we will want to switch to the runtime-only build of Vue, to
 *                     further reduce page load. The run-time-only can not parse templates found
 *                     in the html pages.
 *
 *   - Future:         in the future, if we want to switch some parts of the site to a SPA
 *                     like functionality, this will be much easier.
 *
