The `src/vite/src/assets/sass/legacy/` folder contains legacy stylesheets.

Legacy .css files have been renamed to .scss since they have to be maintained or modified somehow, even though they do not follow a BEM methodology and have many stylelint issues.

The `css/` folder is ignored by stylelint.
