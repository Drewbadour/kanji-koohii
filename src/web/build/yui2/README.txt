This folder contains YUI 2.9.0 build files.

They are included because they are to be phased out, and we don't use a lot of YUI2 so the necessary files are now in the repository to simplify the setup for contributors.

Eventually this folder should be phased out.

http://yui.github.io/yui2/

The yui2-bundle.min.js contains code mainly used in "AjaxDialog" (draggable dialogs
as seen on flashcard review page, "edit flashcard", "edit story" dialogs):

- yahoo-dom-event
- /animation/animation-min.js
- /connection/connection-min.js
- /container/container-min.js
- /dragdrop/dragdrop-min.js
